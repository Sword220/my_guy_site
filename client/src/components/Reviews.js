                up into the downstairs bathroom. Our home warranty company sent out Cameron bright and early, and he got the<br /> 
                drain cleared in no time. Now we can finish moving and settling into our new home. Cameron is super friendly,<br /> 
                fast, and I couldn't be happier with the experience. I hope we don't meet again under these circumstances, but<br />
                I feel better knowing it will go well if it has to be done."

                It turned out our sewage pipe coming from one upstairs toilet was clogged, so he came back with his equipment<br /> 
                and fixed the clog in less than 30 minutes. No mess left behind and a fully functional bathroom since. Highly<br /> 
                recommend My Guy!!"

                in the street and so we thought it was the new connection. The city has been out and said there is no problem.<br /> 
                Long story short we were introduced to Cameron through a Connect Utah interview. He came out this morning and<br /> 
                explained to us what the real problem was and had it fixed within minutes. He also gave us pointers for the future.<br /> 
                Great job Cameron. Exactly the kind of service we like to give our customers and expect from other service providers.<br /> 
                You will always be our Guy and the Guy we recommend!"

                sense to him. Instead of going right for the drain he checked everything else out first and found the problem was actually<br /> 
                electrical. I tried to pay Cameron for his time but he insisted it was no problem and that he has happy he could help.<br />
